/**
 * A FileSystemView class that limits the file selections to a single root.
 * <p>
 * When used with the JFileChooser component the user will only be able to traverse the directories contained within the specified
 * root fill.
 * <p>
 * The "Look In" combo box will only display the specified root.
 * <p>
 * The "Up One Level" button will be disable when at the root.
 * <p>
 * Thanks to Rob Camick. This class is designed to be used once, for one ROOT directory. To limit the file chooser to search the
 * files in my Java JDK I used: <br>
 * File root = new File("c:/java/jdk6.7"); <br>
 * FileSystemView fsv = new SingleRootFileSystemView( root );<br>
 * JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser(fsv);
