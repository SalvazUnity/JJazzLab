# JJazzLab

JJazzLab is a Midi-based application dedicated to backing tracks generation. You type in chord symbols, select a rhythm (style), then the application generates a complete backing track with drums, bass, guitar, piano, strings, etc. 

The objective is to generate **intelligent and interesting backing tracks**, i.e tracks which are: 
- realistic
- non-boring (with variations)
- easily customizable, even for complex songs

From version 4.0 JJazzLab embeds its own customized software synth based on FluidSynth. For even better sounds, just connect JJazzLab to VST plugins via a virtual Midi cable and a VST host.

## An open architecture

![JJazzLab architecture](https://github.com/jjazzboss/JJazzLab/blob/master/graphics/JJazzLab-architecture.jpg)

JJazzLab is based on the [Apache Netbeans Platform](https://netbeans.org/features/platform/features.html) which provides a reliable and extensible application architecture via plugins.

Developers can easily add music generation capabilities or try new ideas, without taking care of all the "plumbing".
