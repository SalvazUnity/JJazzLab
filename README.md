# JJazzLab

JJazzLab is a Midi-based framework dedicated to backing tracks generation -some people talk about "play-along songs" or “auto-accompaniment applications”. You type in chord symbols, select a rhythm (style), then the application generates a complete backing track with drums, bass, guitar, piano, strings, etc. 

The objective is to develop a jam buddy able to quickly generate intelligent and interesting backing tracks: realistic and non-boring backing tracks which you can easily adjust to a specific song.

## Example

To see the JJazzLab capabilities download and try the JJazzLab application at [www.jjazzlab.com](https://www.jjazzlab.com), it's a JJazzLab distribution which bundles the YamJJazz music generation engine based on Yamaha style files. You can also check out the demo videos: [JJazzLab YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0L3SwjY6bhTj6jsbOYzzAw).

## Develop your own music generation engine without hassle

Thanks to JJazzLab developers can save a huge amount of work by only focusing on their music generation engine. Out of the box, the JJazzLab framework provides all the infrastructure, all the “plumbing” that, before, every developer had to write themselves. 

JJazzLab is based on the [Netbeans Platform](https://netbeans.org/features/platform/features.html) (now hosted by the Apache foundation). It provides a reliable and extensible application architecture.

The Netbeans Platform turns JJazzLab into a pluggable application where plugins can be installed or deactivated at runtime. Plugins can easily add/alter features and insert UI elements such as menu items.
