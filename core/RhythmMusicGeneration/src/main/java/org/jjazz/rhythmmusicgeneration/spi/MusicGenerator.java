     * Generate the note Phrases which correspond to a musical accompaniment for a given rhythm.
     * <p>
     * The service provider must compute one Phrase per RhythmVoice/Midi channel. The MidiMix from <code>context</code> provides the Midi channel associated to
     * each RhythmVoice via <code>MidiMix.getChannel(RhythmVoice)</code>. Phrases must be provided for all RhythmVoices (though a Phrase can be empty),
     * including for the possible RhythmVoiceDelegates used by the Rhythm.
     * <p>
     * If the context song contains several rhythms, the method must add notes ONLY for bars which use this MidiMusicGenerator's rhythm. For example, if context
     * range is bars 3-4 with rhythm1 on bar3 and rhythm2 on bar4, then the rhythm1 generator must add notes for bar 3 only.
     * <p>
     * Note that the following features are directly managed by the JJazzLab framework by postprocessing the output of generateMusic():<br>
     * - Midi Instrument selection and settings (Program changes, Midi controller messages such as bank select, volume, reverb, panoramic) <br>
     * - RP_SYS_Mute rhythm parameter handling (muting a specific track for a specific SongPart)<br>
     * - RP_SYS_DrumsMix rhythm parameter handling (adjusting some drums track instruments velocity)<br>
     * - RP_SYS_CustomPhrase rhythm parameter handling <br>
     * - RP_STD_Fill rhythm parameter handling for the "fade_out" value (MusicGenerator must handle the other values)<br>
     * - Handling of the channel's specific velocity shift<br>
     * - Handling of the instrument's specific transposition<br>
     * - Drums rerouting<br>
     * - NC chord symbols<br>
     *
     * @param context      The information to be used for music generation
     * @param rhythmVoices Generate music only for these RhythmVoices, or for all RhythmVoices if nothing specified
     * @return One Phrase per rhythm voice/channel.
